## **What Gets Created**

### **Core Tables for "For One Day":**
- ✅ `profiles` - User accounts
- ✅ `families` - Family groups  
- ✅ `family_members` - Who belongs to which family
- ✅ `devotion_themes` - Weekly devotional content
- ✅ `devotion_entries` - **Your daily reflections**
- ✅ `vault_items` - **Your legacy letters & notes**
- ✅ `subscriptions` - Billing (for later)

### **Sample Data:**
- ✅ **"A Week of Gratitude"** devotional theme
- ✅ Scripture: 1 Thessalonians 5:18
- ✅ 6 daily reflection prompts
- ✅ Perfect for testing!

## **Test Your Setup**

### **The Complete Flow:**
1. **Sign up** at your app → Creates your profile + family
2. **Go to `/devotional`** → See today's scripture & prompt
3. **Write reflection** → Click "Save Reflection" → Stored in `devotion_entries` ✅
4. **Create legacy note** → Fill out the form → Click "Save to Legacy Vault" → Stored in `vault_items` ✅
5. **Go to `/vault`** → See your saved letters ✅

### **Example Legacy Note:**
```
Title: "Letter for My Daughter's Wedding Day"
Recipient: "My Daughter"  
Occasion: "wedding day"
Content: "My dearest daughter, on your wedding day I want you to know..."
```
→ **Saved forever in your family's vault!** 💝

## **Troubleshooting**

### **If you get errors:**
- Make sure you're in the **SQL Editor** (not the Table Editor)
- Copy the **entire** `setup-complete.sql` file
- Run it **all at once** (don't split it up)

### **If tables already exist:**
- The script will **drop and recreate** everything
- Your data will be reset (that's okay for setup)

### **To verify it worked:**
- Go to **Table Editor** in Supabase
- You should see all the tables listed
- Click on `devotion_themes` → Should have 1 row ("A Week of Gratitude")
