# 🎯 Final Recommendation: Push Strategy & UX Flow

## ⚠️ Should We Push First?

### **YES - Push RLS Fix + Current Features NOW**

**Why:**
1. ✅ **RLS fix is critical** - Users can't sign up without it
2. ✅ **Turn the Page works** - Core feature is functional
3. ✅ **Can iterate on UX** - Improve based on real usage
4. ✅ **Professional approach** - Ship working features, iterate

## 🎨 Expert UX Analysis: Unified Flow

### **Current State (After Push):**
- Turn the Page and Reflection are **two separate cards**
- Works functionally, but feels disconnected
- Users understand both features work
- **Acceptable for v1**

### **With Unified Flow (Next Iteration):**
- **"Your Daily Practice"** - One unified experience
- **Step 1: Turn the Page** → **Step 2: Reflection**
- Progressive disclosure (complete Step 1 → Step 2 becomes primary)
- **Feels like one spiritual practice**
