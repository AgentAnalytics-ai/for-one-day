On this, your wedding day, my heart is full of joy and pride. I remember the day you were born, and now I watch as you begin this beautiful new chapter of your life.

Marriage is one of life's greatest gifts. Here's what I want you to remember:

1. Love is a choice you make every day, not just a feeling
2. Put God at the center of your marriage
3. Never stop dating your spouse
4. Learn to forgive quickly and completely
5. Laugh together often

I pray that your marriage will be a reflection of God's love for His people.

With all my love,
