## 🎯 CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

### 1. **DATABASE MIGRATION** (URGENT)
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- Copy contents of supabase/restore-missing-tables.sql
```

### 2. **ROW LEVEL SECURITY** (URGENT)
- Family APIs need proper RLS policies
- Voice upload needs storage bucket policies

### 3. **NAVIGATION LINKS** (MEDIUM)
- `/devotional` link points to deleted page
- `/table-talk` link points to deleted page
- `/reflections` link should be `/reflection`

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Copy `supabase/restore-missing-tables.sql` content
2. Paste in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Click "Run"
4. Verify success

### Step 2: Test Core Features
1. **Daily Reflections** - Should work after migration
2. **Voice Recording** - Should work after migration
3. **Legacy Notes** - Should work (already working)
4. **Family Sharing** - Should work after migration
5. **Settings** - Should work (already working)

### Step 3: Fix Navigation
1. Update navigation links to point to existing pages
2. Remove links to deleted pages

## 📈 EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER MIGRATION

### ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- Daily reflection system
- Voice recording and playback
- Legacy notes with recipient selection
- Family member invitations
- Settings with executor/emergency contacts
- Stripe subscription management

### ⚠️ **PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL**
- Family sharing (needs RLS policies)
- Stats tracking (needs user_stats table)

### ❌ **NOT FUNCTIONAL** (intentionally removed)
- Quizzes and gamification
- Table talk games
- Family calendar and tasks
- Complex devotional system
